# Jean Sebastian

I'm a passionate software engineer with experience in backend development. Over the past two years, I've been deeply involved in social media and Customer Data Platform projects, focusing on leads integrations and Attribution Marketing. I consider myself a proactive and goal-oriented individual with an optimistic outlook.

Currently, I'm pursuing a double degree at IMT Mines Al√®s, specializing in Artificial Intelligence.
