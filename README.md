### [ChatApp](https://github.com/Sebas03446/ChatApp)

A personal project exploring generative AI models. The application features a specialized API to create an initial character for generating the first prompt. 
#### Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI

### [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://github.com/Sebas03446/The-Last-Algorithms-Course-You-ll-Need)  
A collection of algorithms and data structures inspired by the course "[The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)" from FrontendMasters. Implemented in Python, the repository includes tests using pytest and covers concepts such as sorting, recursion, searching, heaps, and tree traversals.
#### Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** Python, Pytest
