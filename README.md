I'm a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in languages and puzzles. Over the past two years, I've been deeply involved in social media and Customer Data Platform projects, focusing on leads integrations and Attribution Marketing. I consider myself a proactive and goal-oriented individual with an optimistic outlook.

Currently, I'm pursuing a double degree at IMT Mines Al√®s, specializing in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I have two years of experience as a Backend Developer working with Golang.

## About My Projects

### [AmbientCalculus Language](https://github.com/Sebas03446/AmbientCalculusLanguage/tree/master)

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of the Ambient Calculus programming language. It covers the essential aspects of running the language, grammatical categories, code descriptions, and concluding remarks. Notably, the project leverages ANTLR4 with Go and Dot to facilitate syntax tree generation.
